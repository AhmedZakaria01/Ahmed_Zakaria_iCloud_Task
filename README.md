# Notes :

1- i used redux insted of context .
2- icone might not be as it needed because i didn't find them .
3- i used Redux in the Home page and then i used props just to save some time .
4- UI might not be 100% same as figma because i was focusing on thel logic because its the hard part .

Thanks for reading
